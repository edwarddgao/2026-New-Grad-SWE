## Conclusion

**Is Simplify comprehensive enough?**

**No.** Using Simplify alone means missing **43%** of opportunities. The coverage gap breaks down as:

| Gap Source | What You're Missing |
|------------|---------------------|
| **levels.fyi gap (23%)** | Plaid, Unity, monday.com, Verily, LaunchDarkly, Raytheon, DTCC |
| **Neither platform (20%)** | Government jobs, gaming studios, healthcare, startups, regional companies |

### Recommendations

1. **Tier 1: Essential Sources (covers 80%)**
   - [SimplifyJobs GitHub](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/New-Grad-Positions) - 57% coverage
   - [levels.fyi/jobs](https://www.levels.fyi/jobs) - adds 23%

2. **Tier 2: Complete Coverage (adds remaining 20%)**
   - [jobright-ai repos](https://github.com/jobright-ai/2025-Software-Engineer-New-Grad) - direct scraping
   - [Indeed](https://indeed.com) - broad coverage
   - Company career pages directly

3. **Aggregator Approach**
   - Use the `aggregator/sources.py` module in this repo to pull from all sources automatically
   - Deduplicates by URL, enriches with salary data links

4. **Scraping levels.fyi for career pages**
   - Worth it for the 23% gap (48 companies with quality jobs like Plaid, Unity)
   - 34,316 companies on levels.fyi not on Simplify
   - Focus on companies with salary data (indicates they're actively hiring)
